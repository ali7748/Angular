# Readme
in this repo I'm trying to learn,practice and maybe develope an **Angular** app or webpage.

# Dependencies and usage:
first Download and install [nodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) .
then install Angular CLI by following Command:
```
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```
after that to run project:
```
$ cd "file location"
$ ng serve --open
```
now you can see result on your localhost address in the browser .
